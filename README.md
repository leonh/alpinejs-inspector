# alpinejs-inspector
An intentionally simple drop in script that allows you to inspect the state of Alpine JS variables and stores. Stores and variables can be viewed/edited via a pop-up widget on your page (styled with tailwind css) 

# modal overlay with data tab and store tab

If you want a more full-featured debugger then there is a official paid one that the Alpine js devs maintain. If your needs are simple then this might suffice :-)  


#setup
after you load alpine load the script. eg.
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
<script src="/replace-with-your-path-to/alpine-store-debugger.js"></script>
```
